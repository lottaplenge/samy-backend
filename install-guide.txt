                npm --version
              to ensure that npm is installed correctly on your Mac.

2. Download the samy-backend code repository
    Go to https://github.com/lottaplenge/samy-backend, download the repository as a ZIP file and unpack it in your
    desired location on your computer

    OR

    In your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA in this example)
        - Go to File > New > Project from Version Control
        - Select Repository URL on the left
        - Select Git in the dropdown
        - Paste the link to the backend repository in the URL field and specify your desired location on your computer
        - Click "Clone"

3. Install project dependencies
   - Open a Console/Terminal and navigate into the samy-backend folder
   OR
   - When you have the project open in IntelliJ IDEA you can open the terminal at the bottom and you should already be
     in the samy-backend folder
   - Run
        npm install
     to install the project dependencies

4. Create run configuration
   - In IntelliJ IDEA go Run(on the top) > Edit configurations
   - Click on the (+) Icon
   - Select npm
   - Fill the fields like follows
        Name:           start
        package.json:   select the path to where the package.json lies (usually you don't need to touch this)
        Command:        run
        Scripts:        start
   - Click Apply

5. Create .env File
   - In IntelliJ IDEA create a new file in the top level (samy-backend) directory
   - Name it ".env"
   - Write:

        MONGO_USER="_____"
        MONGO_PASSWORD="_____"

     and fill the blanks (_) with the username and password you received

6. Run
   - Click on the little Run (>) button in the top right toolbar
   OR
   - Run
        npm start
     in the terminal

   If everything works correctly the run console should be displaying
        Server Listening on Port 3000
        db connected
